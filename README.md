# HomeworkAppUI
This project's aim is to build a JAVA FX project to create a homework agenda which includes adding deleting and editing homework items. 

This project needs to read datas from an sql database to show them on a GUI including lecture name, details of the specific homework and deadline for that homework.

Homework items should be sorted such that closest deadline should appear in top and the latest deadline should apper in the bottom.

Also this UI needs to have 3 slection field. Today's items, This week's items and Long Term Projects.

If user selects Todays items field he/she should only see the homework which are due for today.
If user selects This week's homework field he/she should only see homeworks which are due for a week from now including the earlier ones(for 2 days or 3 days later homeworks should appear in here).
If user selects Long Term Projects field user should see projects which are due for after 2 weeks.(This field shouldn't show earlier dues than 2 weeks)
